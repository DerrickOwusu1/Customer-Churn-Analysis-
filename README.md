# Customer Churn Analysis

**The business problem:**
We’re a telco startup. Our churn rate is high, and leadership needs to know: Who’s churning, why, and how can we stop it?

**Objective:**
Segment the customer base and analyze **behavioral** & demographic patterns causing the churn, using SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

**Tools usage:**
SQL (MySQL) → Data wrangling, cohort segmentation, churn metrics
Excel → Quick summaries, pivot tables
Tableau → Data storytelling via dashboards
